# 00. Intro

Play framework has some authentication and authorization [modules](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ModuleDirectory). **SecureSocial** is one of them. **Silhouette** is good as well, still **SecureSocial** has merit; it is simple. But it has a problem. It's document is outdated, so much. Because of this problem, you have to read official document and it's code to learn it. Scala demo is very enough to learn about this module, but it does not use DB.

I start this because I had a lot of difficulties to learn and want make others evade that I suffered.

In this document I will expalin how to implement [SecureSocial](https://github.com/jaliss/securesocial) to Play framework 2.5.x with Slick 3.1.x and this project starts from play-scala template.
